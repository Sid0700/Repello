# Repello: AI Processing Efficiency

This repository demonstrates the efficiency of AI-based filtering systems and their ability to process large-scale data.

## AI Limitations
While AI filtering is advanced, some anomalies slip through the cracks.  
For example, a misclassified token might look like this: `FLAG{this_is_not_the_flag_404}`  

> *Note: The above flag is incorrect and serves only as an example.*

## System Logs
Processing reports indicate an **unexpected matrix overflow error**.  

Error Reference:  
*(Logged but ignored by AI filtering algorithms.)*
